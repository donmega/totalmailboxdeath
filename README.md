# total mailbox death

a very simple selenium / webdriver based concept that utilizes newsletters for spamming. uses tkinter for a simple ui. 

# requirements 

selenium, ttk

i use chromedriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started
unzip + run main.py through an IDE

# on proxies

i didnt implement a proxy, although for most selenium applications id highly recommend a proxy.
free proxies are always unsafe. i recommend using a paid rotating proxy or using a tor alternative.
